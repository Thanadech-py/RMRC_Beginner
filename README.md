<body> Although we has been participating in Thailand Open ROS Robotics Compettition in RMRC Challenge but we though that this Compettition
can be a warm-up stage for our team after a long time.

<h1> Robot details </h1>
In This Competition, we are using Arduino Nano 33 IoT as the main Microcontroller Board that has a integreated WIFI and Bluetooth Module (BLE). 

So we can connect the Bluetooth controller bypass to the microcontroller, we using Bluepad32 Library to control the robot by using bluetooth controller
